[Learning numbers for the very small - fast paced arcade action for the others]

This version was built upon another game available on the web which I tried in the first place. I got inspired to extent the basic game with additional features. The game itself is great for spending evenings with friends with a glass of wine or two. I watched my 2 1/2 year old girl playing with the prototype and then thougt: why not create an additional game mode for learning the numbers from 1 to 10, together with a friend. Then it began.

Features are:

Standard mode: 2 player game from 0 to 100, penalty -1 when wrong button was pressed, no limits in speed or rounds
Kid mode: 2 player game from 1 to 10, no penalty
